# kfs
This is our repository for 42's `kfs` (kernel from scratch) project. The aim is to build
a fully functional 32-bit kernel. 


## Requirements
This project is separated into 10 subprojects.
- [x] kfs-1
  - [x] Bootable via GRUB
  - [x] ASM multiboot header
  - [x] Basic kernel library
  - [x] Basic code to print stuff on the screen
  - [x] Scroll and cursor support
  - [x] I/O interface with colors support
  - [x] Handles keyboard entries
  - [x] Handles different screens with shortcuts to switch between them
